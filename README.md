# Weekplanner

This is a short programming task designed to let you demonstrate your skills in frontend web development. You should aim to spend around 2 hours on this task.

## The Problem

Users have a list of sessions they should complete within a week. Your task is to build a tool to help them organise those sessions within the week. For example, the user might have the following sessions:

 - Max Hangs
 - Max Hangs
 - Indoor Bouldering
 - Pull Ups

 and they may decide to schedule their sessions as

  - Tuesday: Max Hangs, Indoor Bouldering
  - Thursday: Max Hangs, Pull Ups

The tool should provide information to help the user make scheduling decisions. For example, if the user only has 1 hour to train on a given day they would not want to schedule sessions lasting more than 1 hour.

A mobile form factor should be targeted.

## Resources

A file called `data.json` is provided containing a list of sessions to be scheduled. Your tool should load data from this file.

## Deliverables

You should start by forking this repo. Commit your changes to your fork and provide a link to your forked repo.

The tool should consist of an html file that you can open in the browser to use the tool. Google Chrome will be used. Additional js and css files may also be included in the repo. External dependencies are allowed.
